This is a generic API for sites of non-profitable organizations which assists locals and 
other kind of services as well. 
The main idea is that anyone can grab this API and write a customized version of a site for 
those institutions.
My main mission is to ease the life of people doing _pro bono_ work and help charities to 
improve communication with their target public.

## Motive

I know there are very nice platforms and CMS like Wordpress, but I did not managed to find 
a platform which fit this kind of work and I *really wanted to improve my Rails* skills. 
:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## Development tools and libraries

This is a API only Rails application using the following technologies:

* Ruby 2.4+
* Rails 5.1+
* PostgreSQL 9.6+

### System dependencies

* Linux (You can try to run on M$ Window$, but why bother?)
* ImageMagick


## Feature status and roadmap

This project is a *_WORK IN PROGRESS_*, any kind of help is welcome.
